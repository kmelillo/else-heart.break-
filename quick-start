This short quick-start will get you a quick Modifier (The Hotel_Modifier)

Once you reach Hotel Devotchka, use the guest computer in the lobby, and enter
the following commands, wait for each to execute.

door
Hotel_Corridor_Door4

Then go to Room 4 (through the kitchen, and upstairs)
The Hotel_Modifier is under a chair.
You can also pick up a screwdriver here. 

So you don't ruin the story at this point, you may want to check-in, and get your
room door fixed.  After that is complete, you can sleep.  

Now it is time to get the next Modifier.  You need two in order to upgrade.  

Hack the Fuse-Box in your room, and add the following code:

Connect("Lodge_Room1_ModernComputer_1")
Slurp()

The modifier is in the corner, but do not pick it up yet.  Hack it.

bool Allow(string target, number level)
    return true
end

Now you can modify anything in the game!

Choose any computer in the room, and hack it.

Connect("Hotel_Office_DoorToBasement")
Slurp()

In the basement you will find the Extractor, which is needed to tell you the name
of any item it is used on.

Exit back up to the Lobby, and start your normal game, with full hacking available!
